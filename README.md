# HTR_RCNN_BLSTM 
Hand writing and wild scene text recognition with Bilateral Long Short Term Memory Recurrent Convolutional Neural Network
MJSynth dataset (10 Gb) Dataset Source : https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/text/#sec-synth.<br><br>
This dataset consists of 9 million images covering 90k English words, and includes the training,
validation and test splits used in our work A small subset of data is kept in mnt/ you can try training
and evaluation on that dataset, beacuase training on actual data may take days as per compute available.<br><br>
